# Implementing-the-GradeUtil-API

In project #01 you did the hard work of developing test cases against a set of Grade Analysis utility functions.  In this assignment you get to reap the benefit of that hard work and use those test cases to help you implement those functions.

The details are simple: implement the 11 functions defined in the “gradeutil.hfile”.
